## Hello!!
Weather App works with api provided by openweather.org. By using this app you can see the weather conditions and 
local time all around the world. 
Distance local time is calculated through using time zone difference between distance and user's time zone.
Weather situation icons fetched from openweather.org's related urls to the related weather conditions.
According to the weather conditions and day time background images changes to give a user a better understanding
of current weather in destination.


Happy Coding...
